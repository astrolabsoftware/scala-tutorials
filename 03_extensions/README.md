# Domain Specific Language and Scala

Scala is a portmanteau of scalable and language, to reflect the fact that the language is designed to grow and easily integrate new features over time. One direct outcome from this is the possibility to create Domain Specific Language (DSL) on top of Scala (which is a general-purpose programming language). A DSL is a computer language specialized to a particular application domain. Reasons for wanting a DSL are mainly two: support new syntax, and support new functionality.

Among several, the most popular DSL on top of Scala are: Apache Spark, Scala Build Tool (SBT), Akka, ScalaTest, Chisel, ... It is worth noting that Apache Spark has greatly contributed to the popularity of Scala!

In the future, I plan to add two sections, on Apache Spark and SBT! Stay tuned.
